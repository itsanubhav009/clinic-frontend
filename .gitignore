This is a very common and important error to run into!

The problem is that you're trying to push your node_modules folder to GitHub. This folder contains thousands of files and is often very large, which is why GitHub has a 100 MB file size limit that you're hitting.

The node_modules folder should never be committed to GitHub. It's a temporary folder that anyone can recreate perfectly just by running npm install. The only thing you need to save is the "recipe" for it, which is your package.json file.

Here is how to fix it in four simple steps.

## Step 1: Create a .gitignore File
First, you need to tell Git to ignore the node_modules folder. You do this with a special file called .gitignore.

In your terminal, inside the clinic-frontend folder, run this command to create the file:

Bash

touch .gitignore
Now, open the new .gitignore file and add the following lines. This will tell Git to ignore node_modules and other unnecessary files.

# Dependencies
/node_modules

# Next.js build output
/.next/
/out/

# Production build folder
/build

# Environment variables
.env*.local

# Log files
*.log

# OS-specific files
.DS_Storenode_modules/
node_modules/
